Instructions from Chris Sherwood:
The main code is in onrdp.f. There is an "include" file....(onrdp.inc), which basically gets read into the .f file in a number of places...this is an old method of semi-hardwiring values like constants or the dimensions of arrays. The model reads info from the onrparam.dat file, is initialized with the onrinit.dat file, and then the model is forced with the info in the onrforce.dat file. Profile output is in onrprof.dat and time-series output is in onrts.dat. The executable actually works on my Win machine (just double click it, and if the input files are present, it will generate the output files). There are some Matlab scripts to read these output files and make plots.
